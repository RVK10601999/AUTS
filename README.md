AUTS, stands for Automated Univariate Time Series, is a project aimed at automating the whole process of TIME SERIES ANALYSIS based on streamlit.
Updates include,
 --> Able to download models and predicted data.
 --> Able to apply transformations and recheck stationarity. 
 --> Able to use an iterative method to build a well - parameterised model as well as to be able to use auto arima as well.
